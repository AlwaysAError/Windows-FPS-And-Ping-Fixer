# Windows-FPS-Ping-Fixer
Tired of Windows running useless processes which take up computer recourses? Well this Batch file script is here to help by closing these useless processes and processes which also put your computer at security risks. This Batch script must be run as admin. Once run as admin you can just minimize it and leave it in the background to do it things as it will loop all commands for how ever long it's open to ensure that these processes stay closed. This will also close processes which are used to track you so it'll make spoofing for games that little bit easier. This script will free up CPU usage, RAM and network usage meaning you get better performance and lower ping.
